WE just published our local git repository to remote git hub repository
few things happened :
1. Automatically created New Remote Repo
2. Made the connection with your local git repo
3. Added all your commits to remote repo

Now our work will continue locally

1. add a new file called note.txt
2. committed the change to the local repo
3. We want this change to be reflected in remote repository so we pushed local commits to remote repository using push origin method
4. Observe it has been added in your repository under GitHub.com
